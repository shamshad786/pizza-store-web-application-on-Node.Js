# pizza-store-web-application-on-Node.Js
Inside this project, I have created both admin dashboard and customer dashboard and used the MongoDB database. And also used Stripe for the payment gateway. All of you are requested to make your own use of MongoDB and stripe payment so that the project works well and you can understand the code well, I have commented on every line by writing in Hindi so that Indian developers can understand that code well. And I haven't hosted this application yet, 


For Test Purpose only:

customer login email,pass -> sam@gmail.com,pass-> sam123

admin login -> email,pass-> admin@admin.com, pass -> sam123
